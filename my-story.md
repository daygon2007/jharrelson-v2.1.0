      <h3>How It All Began</h3>
<p>My introduction into web design and development actually started when I was about 14. I had no idea what HTML was, CSS wasn’t as main stream as tables were still used to design sites. I didn’t even own a computer at the time that supported internet. I had a “pizza box” style computer running Windows 3.1 that I played a billiard game off of a 3.5″ floppy. My friend and I we loved to skateboard at the time. We shot a lot of “footy” (video footage) of us either being awesome or epically failing, mostly failing. We wanted to share our video with our friends but we didn’t know an effective way of doing so. YouTube hadn’t really taken off yet, so this was before Google bought YouTube. Well, my friend decided that he was going to build a website and post our videos on the internet that way we can show them off to our friends. I stayed up with him all night one night watching, we designed in Photoshop 7.0, spliced everything in ImageReady, and outputted everything to HTML. It was crude but effective and took a million hours to load up on dial-up connection. I saw the fruits of our 12 hours of labor and I was hooked. People all over the world could see our videos, our website, we were getting our names out there (not really but I was young and didn’t fully understand all of it).</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, I’m a junior in high school, my school offers a web mastering class. SOLD! The class was just 1 period a day, you had to put in an application and be accepted in order to be in the class. Don’t know how many applications were put in but I got in and that’s all that mattered to me. We started learning how to code HTML using Notepad, a standard text editing application found on every Windows computer. I think about those days where I didn’t know how to structure an HTML document. I had no idea what semantics were. Heck half of the time my stuff didn’t work and I got frustrated. We moved on to Dreamweaver MX after about a month or 2 using Notepad. I’m thankful everyday that I learned in notepad because if I have to do on the fly editing and I’m on a computer that does not have an IDE (integrated development environment) I can comfortably make edits to any number of files and languages in notepad or textedit (mac computers). This was the year that really changed the course of my life. This is where I said “this is what I want to do”. That year I learned how to use Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Flash, and was the catalyst to better myself over the summer.</p>
<p>The next year was my senior year in high school, I had spent the summer learning CSS (cascading style sheets) and had a fairly decent grasp on the subject (although I was still learning floats and didn’t know I had to clear them). This was the year I learned that Internet Explorer was going to be my greatest enemy. Chrome did not exist yet, and Firefox was still in the single digits in its version numbers. I ended up teaching the class CSS as my teacher didn’t know it and I knew everything else he was teaching that year, but it allowed me to practice and help others, the start of my second passion.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Since my high school days, I started Krymson Productions and now have parted ways with it, I currently work as a front-end web developer for a large cloud security company. I’m working on getting public speaking opportunities to share my knowledge of the web and enrich the lives of businesses and individuals. If you’re interested in me coming to speak to your group please <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact">contact me</a>. I have a strong focus on Search Engine Optimization and digital marketing as a whole, but I will never be removed from my developer roots.</p>

<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>I have a pretty average personal life, just living the American dream. I have to kids Aidan (oldest) and Ian (youngest), and I'm with my high school sweetheart Elizabeth, oh and can't forget about my pup Chance because I'm a dog lover... Not a fan of cats. I make an honest living and I have the best job in the world as a web developer. My goal in life is to become a small business consultant and public speaker sharing the knowledge of how to become successful with digital marketing.</p>
<p>On my "freetime" you can find me playing on Xbox (gamer tag daygon07) or on Codecademy adding more programming languages to may arsenal. If I'm not doing that I' busy stalking Rand Fishkin from Moz and trying to absorb as much information from him as I can.</p>
