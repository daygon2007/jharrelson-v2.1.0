						<h3>Matthew Caldwell</h3>
						<p>Matt is a good buddy of mine and was the other guy behind the scenes when I was running Krymson Productions. Compared to me, Matt is more of the "power user" focusing on more back end development. Currently he lives in Kentucky and is working for a digital marketing agency as as lead developer.</p>
						<p>Matt has helped my with API calls and parsing and has since started turning me into more of a power user. We feed off of each other and we're more like web brothers than anything else. Matt's been the main person I lean on when I'm not seeing something or having an issue and vise versa. When we work together I make stuff look pretty and represent both of us when speaking to clients, he just sits in his shadows, where he likes it, and codes away.</p>

					<h3>Ronald Earl Wilsher</h3>
					<p>Ronald has been one of the biggest influencers on taking what I love and enriching people's lives. Ronald is a public speaker and "Lead Instigator" at Wilsher Media Group. When Ronald isn't busy speaking, he's spending time with his lovely girlfriend, the always lovely Ms. Katherine Crawford Wheat. If you ever need some inspiration and motivation, reach out to Ronald, he always knows just what to say.</p>

					<h3>Rand Fishkin</h3>
					<p>Rand is the CEO of Moz, one of the internet's best sources for anything digital marketing and SEO. Unknowingly to him, mainly because he has yet to meet me, he has changed the way I think about the internet. Search Engine Optimization has always been apart of my routine, but since finding out about Moz, previously SEOMoz, I pretty much live on their site absorbing as much info on SEO as possible. I'm hoping to meet Rand at the 2016 MozCon. What really sets Rand apart, for me, is I know I can tweet him and he'll respond back.</p>

				<h3>Everyone Else</h3>
				<p>There are many more than those above that deserve credit, my family and other friends, too many to list. But the people above have really helped me develop both personally and professionally. If I did not mention your name above, please don;t take offense because it would take me years to mention everyone, regardless I thank everyone for impacting me in some way, shape, or form.</p>
