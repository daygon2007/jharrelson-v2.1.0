<p>SEO or Search Engine optimization is a great practice to reach new customers. With the way the economy is, people are opting to stay in and do research before spending money on gas to find a service or product. Many people for that fact opt to just shop online so they don’t have to face the crowds, use the local Google search and find a service provider in their local area. This is where SEO comes in to play and the reason why small businesses should make it part of their marketing strategy.</p>

<p>To start off there is tons of research involved in this process, and with most small business owners, there’s just not enough time to run and manage your business, and do research for your online presence. This is where a company or an individual that specializes in SEO is a good investment. The company or individual will research the keywords that are best suited for your business and industry. Following that content has to be revised to correlate with your keywords and numerous HTML changes have to be fixed to best optimize your site. Finally after all of that is done, your website get submitted  to all of the major search engines. I personally focus on the "Big Three", Google, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>

<p>Now that your website is set up it has to be updated on a regular basis with genuine, new, relevant information that is informative for people to share and get new people to visit your site. These new visitors will stand a higher chance of becoming a conversion for you. This gives people more of a reason to come back to your site if you don’t sell products on your site. It can;t be just any type of content. I has to be content that readers find useful and "share worthy".</p>

<p>The next step is promoting your small business locally. People don’t want to travel very far from the comfort of their home to get what they need; this is where local SEO makes its appearance. Have you ever Googled a service or a store and saw the map of where those locations are? You could be on that map and be within the proximity of the potential customer and make that conversion. One of the businesses we run SEO services for, <a title="Bits and Bytes Computers" href="http://www.bitsandbytes-computers.com/">Bits &amp; Bytes Computers</a>, 60% of their new business is from that local Google search, it’s a huge asset to them and it’s a vital tool for any small business.</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimization should never be your primary marketing tool for your website and business, it’s a big part, but it should not be the primary tool. Telling your current customers about your site while giving them a business card with the site URL is an effective way of promoting your site and bringing in new clients as well. Get reviews, monitor review sites such as <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank">Google Places</a> </p>

<p>The economy is not what it was 10 years ago, but neither is the internet and SEO is a powerful marketing tool to aid your small business in this time of economic struggles.
